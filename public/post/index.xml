      <description>How’s it going everyone?! Well, I decided to join Thomas Mock’s #TidyTuesday on twitter and this is my second submission. I’ll write a second post on my first submission because that took a little longer to figure out. Anyway let’s get going! First, let’s import the necessary packages
